# Dungeon of Guns
## [Original here](https://github.com/HideyBoi/topdown-pvp)
*Work in progress recreation of an earlier project.*

This recreation features much more robust code in an entirely different engine.

This project has several issues at the moment. Namely,
* This was my first time doing a deep dive into Godot
* This was my first project with a teammate
* This is one of my most complicated projects to date

I've run out of motivation to continue working on this project at the moment. It's been my focus for two years now and I want a break.
I've been creatively burned out for ages and this project has not helped.
In addition school has been draining me.


Looking forward though, I have some things cooking.
Stay tuned :)
